# Emulated Woz Machine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/st3fan/ewm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/st3fan/ewm)

## Introduction

Two years ago between christmas and new year I wrote a tiny and incomplete 6502 emulator and turned it into an original *Apple 1* emulator. It was a fun and nostalgic project to work on. I grew up with the *Apple II* and never had a chance to see an *Apple 1* in action.

A few weeks ago I decided to pick this project up again. I am extremely motivated to turn this into a high quality emulator that supports the *Apple 1*, *Replica 1*, *Apple ][+* and *Apple IIe*. Some of that work is really close to being finished, other work will take many months of spare time hacking.

## Goals & Status

Here are some of the things I want to accomplish for each emulated machine:

### CPU Emulator 

* ~~6502 support~~
* ~~65C02 support~~
* ~~Tracing facility~~
* Debugger
* Speed throttling

### Apple 1

*8K / 6502 / Classic ROM*

* ~~Terminal based emulation~~
* ~~Classic display emulation (SDL based)~~
* Cassette interface

### Replica 1

*32K / 65C02 / KRUSADER ROM*

* ~~Terminal based emulation~~
* ~~Classic display emulation (SDL based)~~
* Cassette interface
* [CFFA1](http://dreher.net/?s=projects/CFforApple1&c=projects/CFforApple1/main.php) Support

### Apple ][+

*48K / 6502*

* ~~Basic Apple ][+ architecture implementation - In progress~~
* ~~Disk II emulation - In progress~~
* ~~Display Emulation - 40 Column mode~~
* ~~Display Emulation - Low resolution graphics~~
* ~~Apple Language Card~~
* ~~Joystick Support~~
* Audio Support
* Display Emulation - High resolution graphics - Mostly works.

## Building the emulator

```
cd src
make
```

## Running the emulator

From the command line:

```
./src/ewm two --color --drive1 disks/DOS33-SamplePrograms.dsk
```
